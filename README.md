# StickyPaws-levelevatorV0
A work in progress Sticky Paws level converter written in Ruby

Currently can:

 - Make Sticky Paws 1 levels from after the Catlyn Update work* on Sticky Paws DX
 - Seems pretty user friendly for me, at least for a command line application
 - Be the first one ever made I think
 - That's it

*not fully, as for now it can't generate the Object Placement.txt file which can make issues, also converted arrows point only in one direction and strong springs end up just springs

Future goals:

  - Get those not fully working things more working
  - Add support of older Sticky Paws versions (level codes)
  - Add backporting of the levels so the code ones can play on Github 1 (I think it's not that hard actually) and so DX ones to play on 1 (??)
  - Rewrite the whole thing into a level/mod installer with graphical interface and actually actually pretty easy to use (that's the future)


How to run:

Well, install Ruby, run the script. It's pretty straightforward in Linux. (Windows and Mac I have no idea)
Maybe I will detail it more after the levels convert fully (at that point I will drop "work in progress" title).
Afterwards, just follow the instructions that the script gives you.

The code should not be hard to understand, so if I don't build on it, anyone could probably rewrite this in a better way. 

At the end, I just want to say that I do not take responsibility of what happens to your computer after you run it, though nothing bad shouldn't. If somehoww it does, let me know though, so I can try to fix that.

And also yes, I am aware this code is not the best it could be. But it works! (mostly)
